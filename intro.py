'''introduction to the creation of the Python language
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
It was designed with an emphasis on code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
Python is an interpreter language. It means it executes the code line by line. Python provides a Python Shell,
which is used to execute a single Python command and display the result.

What is a PEP?
PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.
It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. 
The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. 
A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, 
like design and style, for the community.

When you write Python code, you have to name a lot of things: variables, functions, classes, packages, and so on.
Choosing sensible names will save you time and energy later. You’ll be able to figure out, from the name,
what a certain variable, function, or class represents.
You’ll also avoid using inappropriate names that might result in errors that are difficult to debug.

name = "Douglas"
age =21
hubby = "listening to music"

things = ["Douglas", 21, "football", 75.7]
things = ["Douglas", 21, "football", 75.7,'ooooooo']



print(things)
# print(type(age))
# print(type(hubby))
